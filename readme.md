 Your project submission must include clear and detailed documentation with several examples of possible inputs and the output they generate.

The basic idea should be to take some data, preferably real data - not just one 3x3 matrix - and analyze or process it using advanced numerical techniques. Or even better: first generate some data with one program, e.g. by doing some kind of numerical simulation, and then analyze or process it with a second program, so that your project is self-contained. The analysis and/or simulation should perform substantial non-trivial calculations.

As before, if you can't figure out what to do for the project, you can ask your classmates on Piazza, your supervisor, your friends, Google, or me. Some suggestions include: simulations of physical systems, statistical analysis of real or simulated data of any type, image or audio generation or processing, encryption, or compression.
